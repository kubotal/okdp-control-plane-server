# Design Proposal — Manage external and internal connections from the Control Plane

> UI counterpart: branch `feat/connections` on OKDP/okdp-control-plane-ui
> Status: **IMPLEMENTED — behind the KuboCD connection CRDs being installed**

## 1. Problem

A project's services need to reach data that lives elsewhere: a corporate PostgreSQL, an S3
bucket. Nothing in the Control Plane lets a user declare such a resource, check that the
credentials work, or hand it to a deployed service — it has to be wired by hand.

The symmetric gap exists inside a project. If a project runs a Trino, another service of the same
project (an Airflow, say) has no guided way to consume it: someone has to look up the Kubernetes
Service and its port by hand.

Goal: one **Connections** page per project, in two sections — the external resources the user
declares, and what the project's own deployed services expose to one another — plus the same
external list at platform scope for connections shared by every project.

## 2. Current state

> Sections 2 and 10 describe the state at the time this proposal was written, and are kept as the
> context its decisions were taken in. Two things have moved since. The kinds `Interface` and
> `ClusterInterface` are now named `Contract` and `ClusterContract`, and the whole subsystem is
> heading for the KuboCD v0.3.2 release, where it ships as experimental. The decision not to
> depend on a KuboCD branch still holds: the server probes the cluster and degrades cleanly.

- KuboCD models this already, on the **`feat/connection2` branch** (Serge's work): `Connection`,
  `ClusterConnection`, `Interface`, `ClusterInterface`. `ConnectionSpec.outputName` separates
  connections the release controller **manages** (a deployed Trino publishing what it exposes)
  from the **unmanaged** ones a user declares. `status.parent` names the owning release.
- Those CRDs are **not in the KuboCD release the platform runs**: `api/v1alpha1/` on `main` holds
  only `release`, `config`, `context`. `ReleaseStatus` on `main` has no output/connection notion
  at all, so nothing can be read from a Release today.
- The server already has everything else needed: dynamic-client CRD repositories
  (`secret_store_repository.go`), a credentials-Secret convention (`CreateSecretStore` creates
  `<name>-credentials`), and a precedent for probing a live endpoint from the server pod
  (`POST /api/projects/:name/secret-stores/test`, which validates a Vault **token** rather than
  merely reaching the host).

## 3. Decisions

| Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Depend on `feat/connection2`? | **No.** Probe the cluster, degrade cleanly | The feature ships and merges on its own schedule; it activates when the CRDs land, with no code change |
| Where the connectivity test runs | Server pod, like `SecretStoreService.TestConnection` | Reuses the existing precedent; a Job in the project namespace costs RBAC, an image, cleanup and latency for a fidelity gain we do not need yet |
| A test that only reaches the host | **Rejected** | The Vault precedent already refuses `sys/health`: a wrong password must fail the test |
| Types in v1 | `postgresql`, `mysql`, `s3` declarable; `trino` discovered only | Covers the requested cases; the descriptor format makes a fourth type one file |
| Where type descriptors live | JSON embedded in the server, served by API | One descriptor drives the console form, server validation and provider matching. Cluster `Contract` schemas can be layered over them later without touching the API contract |
| Credentials | Kubernetes Secret, referenced by annotation | Keeps `spec.values` exactly the shape a `Contract` schema will validate, and reading a Connection never discloses a password |
| Scope | Project **and** platform-wide (admin) | Some connections are shared by every project |

## 4. API

```
GET    /api/contracts                                 # descriptors + crdAvailable
GET    /api/projects/{project}/connections            # external, unmanaged only
POST   /api/projects/{project}/connections
POST   /api/projects/{project}/connections/test       # never writes to the cluster
PUT    /api/projects/{project}/connections/{name}
DELETE /api/projects/{project}/connections/{name}
GET    /api/projects/{project}/connections/internal   # derived from deployed services
GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/platform-connections[/{name}]    # admin, cluster-scoped
POST   /api/platform-connections/test
```

An empty namespace addresses the cluster-scoped `ClusterConnection` throughout the repository and
service layers, mirroring how KuboCD treats the two as shapes of the same thing — the
project-scoped and platform-wide paths are one code path.

`POST .../test` always answers **200**: a refused connection is a result to display, not a failed
request. The body carries `success`, a human-readable `message` and a `reason`
(`unreachable` | `auth-failed` | `not-found` | `timeout` | `invalid-config` | `unknown`) so the
console can tell a network problem from a credential problem.

## 5. Internal connections

Since `Release.status` carries nothing today, an internal connection is derived from:

1. the Releases of the project namespace, matched to a type through their `okdp.io/service` label;
2. the Kubernetes Services of that namespace, for the endpoint — the port is picked by the name
   the type declares, falling back to the Service's first port.

Nothing is guessed: with no Service backing the release, the endpoint is reported empty rather
than as an address that would not resolve. Headless and per-pod Services are excluded — they
address individual replicas.

Once the CRDs are installed, `ListInternal` overlays the connections the release controller owns
and drops the derived entry for the same release, so what the controller publishes wins.

## 6. Degradation

`ConnectionRepository.Available()` asks the discovery API for the `connections` resource, caching
a negative answer for 30s so installing the CRDs takes effect without a restart. Then:

- reads return an empty list, never an error — an uninstalled optional CRD is the normal state;
- writes return `ErrConnectionsUnavailable`, which the handler maps to **501**;
- `GET /api/contracts` reports `crdAvailable: false`, and the console explains the
  situation and disables creation instead of offering a form that cannot be saved;
- internal connections are unaffected.

## 7. Credentials

`splitValues` separates the fields the descriptor marks `secret` from the rest. The secrets go to
`<name>-credentials` in the project namespace (the platform namespace for cluster-scoped
connections, which have none of their own); the rest becomes `spec.values`. The Connection carries
`okdp.io/credentials-secret: <namespace>/<name>` and never the values themselves. Read paths
return only the **names** of the secret fields, so the console can show a credential as set
without being able to read it.

An edit that does not resubmit a credential keeps the stored one — the console never receives it,
so it cannot resend it. The consequence is that **testing** always demands the credential, even on
an edit: the test endpoint sees only what the form holds.

## 8. Out of scope (this proposal)

- Wiring a connection into a service's deployment parameters. That is the point of the exercise,
  but it belongs with the KuboCD packages once `Contract`s exist for these types.
- Declaring `Contract` CRDs for `postgresql`, `mysql`, `s3`. Until a package ships them, a
  created Connection does not reconcile: the object is correct, the contract it references does
  not exist yet.
- A tester for `trino` — it is discovered, not declared, so there is no form to validate.

## 9. RBAC

Added to the server ClusterRole: `connections` and `clusterconnections` in full CRUD,
`contracts` and `clustercontracts` read-only (they are owned by the packages), and `services`
read-only for endpoint resolution. Rules on a CRD that is not installed are inert, so the chart
applies unchanged on a cluster without them.

## 10. Verification

Run against the dev sandbox, which happens to carry the `feat/connection2` CRDs:

- the five test outcomes are distinguished — success, wrong password, unknown user, missing
  database, closed port — against a real PostgreSQL;
- a created Connection holds **no** password (`spec.values` has host/port/database/user/sslMode
  only) while `warehouse-credentials` does;
- the endpoint announced for an internal connection is genuinely reachable from inside the
  cluster;
- delete removes both the Connection and its Secret;
- external and internal lists never contain each other's entries.

Note for whoever re-runs this: through `kubectl port-forward` a connection appears to Postgres as
coming from `127.0.0.1`, which the official image's `pg_hba.conf` sets to `trust` — a wrong
password is then accepted and the auth test looks broken when it is not. Harden `pg_hba.conf`, or
test from inside the cluster.
