// that is a Namespace carrying the okdp.io/project label.

// Without it, every route under /api/projects/:name passes the raw path
// segment to the Kubernetes client, with the cluster-wide rights of the
// ServiceAccount. GET /api/projects/kube-system/services answers about
// kube-system, and POST /api/projects/okdp-system/connections writes into the
// platform namespace. No per-project authorization can decide anything as long
// as the value it would inspect is not guaranteed to be a project.
//
// Resolution happens once per request and the result is put in the gin context
// under ProjectKey, so a handler needing the description does not fetch it again.
